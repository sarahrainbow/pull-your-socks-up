## How to call the api

With the server running, do a POST request to the `/email` endpoint.

The request body should be in JSON format and contain the following properties:

  - `websiteSignup`: Indicates a new user has signed up on the website.
  - `sockPurchased`: Indicates a user has purchased a sock.
- `userEmail` (string, required): The email address of the user associated with the event.

For example:
```
{
	"eventName": "sockPurchased",
	"userEmail": "sarah@healthtech1.uk"
}
```
Or...
```
{
	"eventName": "websiteSignup",
	"userEmail": "rainbow@healthtech1.uk"
}
```
