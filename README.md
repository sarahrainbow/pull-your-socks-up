## How to call the api

The request body should be in JSON format and contain the following properties:

- `eventName` (string, required): The type of event to trigger the flow. Accepted values are:
  - `websiteSignup`: Indicates a new user has signed up on the website.
  - `sockPurchased`: Indicates a user has purchased a sock.
- `userEmail` (string, required): The email address of the user associated with the event.

For example:
```
{
	"eventName": "sockPurchased",
	"userEmail": "sarah@healthtech1.uk"
}
```
Or...
```
{
	"eventName": "websiteSignup",
	"userEmail": "rainbow@healthtech1.uk"
}
```

`SockPurchased` and `websiteSignup` events should trigger their respective flows shown below ðŸ‘‡

You should observe:
1. 200 response with a message confirming the email process has started and the respective data e.g.
```
{
    "message": "Email processing started",
    "data": {
        "eventName": "sockPurchased",
        "userEmail": "sarah@healthtech1.uk"
    }
}
```
OR if the eventName is invalid, it will return an error.

2. Console log confirming the sock purchase email has been sent (after any delay)
OR an Error will be raised if email fails to send
